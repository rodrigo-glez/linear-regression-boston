# Boston Housing Linear Regression Practice

This short practice project explores the Boston Housing dataset with the goal of applying simple and multiple linear regression models. It emphasizes strong linear relationships between variables and uses exploratory analysis to support modeling decisions.

## Project Goals

- Practice setting up a virtual environment for project isolation
- Gain experience with loading and exploring a real-world dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis
- Practice simple and multiple linear regression using statsmodels

## Dataset

- Source: Scikit-learn's Boston Housing dataset (CSV version)
- Shape: 506 rows Ã— 14 columns
- Target variable: medv (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's)

## Tools Used

-
